        <aside>
        <p>Emesis Blue is a fan feature film for the co-op first person shooter game "Team Fortress 2"; it was released on YouTube by Fortress Films and was written and directed by Chad Payne. I think I'd classify it as a psychological thriller/action horror movie. The movie follows a medic named Fritz, and shows the consequeses of the people in power around him and others weilding the power of life and death in the name of pride and profit.</p>

        <h2>Reasons Why I Love This Movie:</h2>
        <p>It's a trippy psychological puzzle that really gets you to think about what exactly is happening. The movie was made in a 10+ year old 3d program called SFM, but you almost can't tell. The colors and angles in the film are so amazing for a program as notouriously janky and rough as this. Team Fortress 2's community is known for pretty silly, though beloved, fanworks, so seeing something as serious and intriguing as Emesis Blue was a delight to many, including me. It's beautiful and pretty well written and voice acted, so I give it major props.</p>
